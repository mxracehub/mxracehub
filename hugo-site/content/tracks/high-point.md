## The Rolling Hills of Pennsylvania

High Point Raceway has been a staple of American motocross since it first appeared on the AMA Pro Motocross Championship schedule in 1977. Nestled in the rolling hills of southwestern Pennsylvania near the West Virginia border, this iconic track is known for its distinctive red clay surface, dramatic elevation changes, and rich racing history spanning over four decades.

Owned and operated by the Coombs family, founders of the famous Racer X Illustrated magazine, High Point Raceway represents the heart and soul of East Coast motocross. The track combines old-school motocross traditions with modern track design elements, creating a unique challenge that has tested the skills of generations of motocross competitors.

## Track Design and Characteristics

High Point's distinctive characteristics have made it a favorite among riders and fans alike:

- The famous red clay surface provides exceptional traction when moist but can become extremely slick when dry
- Dramatic elevation changes throughout the circuit, with approximately 300 feet of vertical variation
- Natural terrain features incorporated into the layout, including ridge drops and off-camber turns
- The iconic uphill section after the start, where riders power up a steep incline while navigating multiple turns
- Classic motocross jumps integrated with modern rhythm sections and technical obstacles

The track layout has evolved over the decades while maintaining its core identity. Modern track designers have carefully balanced preservation of High Point's classic features with innovations that keep the racing competitive and spectacular for today's high-performance motorcycles.

## East Coast Soil and Weather Variables

High Point's red clay surface represents classic East Coast motocross conditions that differ dramatically from the West Coast venues that start the outdoor season. This clay-based soil:

- Holds moisture well, creating deep ruts that reward technical precision
- Develops a distinctive shine when it gets slick, challenging riders with unpredictable traction
- Forms hardpack edges on jump faces and takeoffs that require precise throttle control
- Changes dramatically throughout the day as it transitions from morning moisture to afternoon dry conditions

The Pennsylvania climate adds another variable, with the June date often featuring hot, humid conditions that test rider fitness. Afternoon thunderstorms are not uncommon, potentially transforming track conditions mid-event and requiring teams to make rapid adjustments to motorcycle setup.

## The Natural Amphitheater

What makes High Point particularly special for spectators is its natural amphitheater design. The track's layout in a valley surrounded by hills provides exceptional viewing opportunities, with many fans able to see nearly the entire circuit from a single vantage point.

Spectator areas on the hillsides surrounding the track create the famous "High Point experience," where fans set up for the day with chairs, canopies, and coolers while enjoying panoramic views of the racing action. The iconic corners where spectators crowd the fences mere feet from the racing line create an electric atmosphere that riders often cite as motivation to push harder.

## Legacy of Champions

The list of High Point National winners reads like a motocross hall of fame. Legendary riders including Bob Hannah, Rick Johnson, Jeff Stanton, Ricky Carmichael, and James Stewart have all conquered the Pennsylvania clay. In recent years, new stars like Eli Tomac, Ken Roczen, and the Lawrence brothers have added their names to this prestigious list.

The track has been the site of many memorable championship battles and career-defining performances. Ricky Carmichael's perfect season in 2002 included a dominant performance at High Point, while James Stewart's legendary battles with Chad Reed electrified fans during their championship rivalry.

## A Family Tradition

High Point holds a special place in American motocross as a family-oriented venue that celebrates the sport's grassroots heritage. The Coombs family's stewardship has ensured that despite the event's growth and the sport's increasing professionalization, High Point maintains the authentic motocross atmosphere that has made it beloved by generations of fans.

Many families have made attending the High Point National an annual tradition, with multiple generations experiencing the sights, sounds, and distinctive red clay of this Pennsylvania motocross institution together. This connection to motocross history and community is palpable throughout the event weekend.

## Beyond the National

While the Pro Motocross National is High Point's premier event, the facility hosts a full calendar of amateur racing throughout the season. Regional championship series, qualifying events for the prestigious Loretta Lynn's Amateur National, and local race series all utilize the same track that challenges the pros (with appropriate modifications).

This accessibility allows amateur riders to test themselves on the same iconic terrain as their professional heroes, creating a direct connection between the grassroots and professional levels of the sport that is central to motocross culture.

The High Point Amateur Days held in conjunction with the National weekend are particularly special, giving young riders the opportunity to compete on a freshly prepared professional track just days after watching their heroes race the same circuit.
