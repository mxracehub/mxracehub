## The New Home of San Diego Supercross

Snapdragon Stadium represents the newest chapter in San Diego's long and storied Supercross history. Opened in 2022, this state-of-the-art facility has taken over from the historic Qualcomm/Jack Murphy Stadium (demolished in 2021) as Southern California's premier Supercross venue.

Built on a portion of the former Qualcomm Stadium site, Snapdragon continues San Diego's tradition of hosting world-class Supercross events while providing modern amenities, improved sightlines, and a more intimate atmosphere for fans. As the newest stadium on the Monster Energy AMA Supercross calendar, Snapdragon offers a blend of Southern California Supercross tradition with contemporary stadium design, creating an exceptional experience for both riders and spectators.

## Facility Overview

As a purpose-built modern stadium, Snapdragon offers several advantages over many older venues on the Supercross circuit:

### Contemporary Design
The stadium's recent construction incorporates:
- Modern architectural approaches that maximize spectator sightlines
- Wider concourses and improved crowd flow
- State-of-the-art video boards and sound systems
- Contemporary premium seating and hospitality options

### Intimate Atmosphere
Despite the venue's 35,000-seat capacity, the design creates:
- Steeper seating angles that bring fans closer to the action
- A more compact footprint than the previous Qualcomm Stadium
- Superior acoustics that amplify crowd energy
- Minimized distance between the furthest seats and the track

### California Climate Advantage
San Diego's legendary weather provides:
- Typically mild January temperatures for comfortable spectating
- Minimal rain concerns for both track preparation and fan experience
- Beautiful sunset backdrops for the evening program
- Consistent conditions for riders and track builders

## Track Characteristics

While each year brings a new track design, Snapdragon's specific characteristics influence several common elements:

### Southern California Soil
The dirt used at San Diego rounds typically features:
- A harder base compared to East Coast stadiums
- Good traction when properly watered and maintained
- Tendency to become slick and blue-grooved as the night progresses
- West Coast hardpack characteristics familiar to California-based riders

### Layout Possibilities
The stadium floor configuration allows for:
- Traditional supercross-style layouts with multiple rhythm sections
- Longer start straights than many stadiums on the circuit
- Good balance between technical sections and racing opportunities
- Room for creative track designs that utilize the full floor space

### Weather Considerations
Although San Diego weather is typically favorable, track builders must consider:
- Morning marine layer moisture that can affect dirt preparation
- Significant temperature drops after sunset requiring adjusted watering schedules
- Occasional winter precipitation that can dramatically alter track conditions
- Dew formation as evening temperatures cool
