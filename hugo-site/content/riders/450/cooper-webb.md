## Champion with Unstoppable Determination

Cooper Webb has established himself as one of the most mentally tough and tactically smart racers in the history of Supercross. Born in Newport, North Carolina, Webb has proven time and again that his race craft and ability to perform under pressure are second to none.

Known for his fierce determination and never-say-die attitude, Webb has earned a reputation as the "comeback kid" with numerous late-race charges and championship comebacks that have cemented his legacy as one of the greats in the sport.

## Professional Career

Cooper Webb began his professional career in 2013 after a successful amateur career. He quickly rose through the ranks of the 250 class, winning both the East and West Supercross championships and the outdoor Pro Motocross championship.

After moving to the premier 450 class in 2017, Webb initially struggled to find his footing. However, a switch to KTM in 2019 led to an immediate turnaround, with Webb clinching his first 450 Supercross championship that same year. He followed this with another championship in 2021.

For the 2023 season, Webb found another gear, battling with Eli Tomac in one of the most exciting championship fights in recent history, ultimately securing his third 450 Supercross championship. In 2024, Webb made a high-profile move back to Yamaha, the brand with which he won his 250 championships.

## Riding Style

Webb is renowned for his technical precision and tactical approach to racing. He excels in tight, technical tracks where his precise cornering and calculated aggression allow him to make passes in places where other riders might not see an opportunity.

One of Webb's greatest strengths is his ability to adapt his riding to the conditions and circumstances of the race. He's often at his best in the closing laps, when other riders begin to fatigue. This ability to turn up the intensity when it matters most has earned him numerous last-lap or last-corner victories.

## Mental Strength and Championships

Perhaps what sets Webb apart most from his competitors is his mental toughness. He's known for his ability to dig deep and find another level when the pressure is highest. This mental fortitude has been a key factor in his championship success, particularly in the closely contested 2023 season.

## Off the Track

Off the track, Webb is known for his intense focus and dedication to his craft. His training program is tailored to peak at the right moments in the season, and he works closely with his team to ensure his bike setup plays to his strengths.

Webb is also known for his close relationship with his wife and family, who provide support at the races. Though sometimes perceived as having a serious demeanor in the racing environment, those close to Webb describe him as relaxed and fun-loving away from the track.

With multiple championships already secured and still in the prime of his career, Cooper Webb continues to build his legacy as one of the sport's all-time greats.
