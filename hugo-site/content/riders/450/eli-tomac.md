## The Modern GOAT

Eli Tomac has established himself as one of the greatest motocross and supercross racers of all time. Born and raised in Cortez, Colorado, in a family deeply embedded in cycling (his father John is a mountain biking legend), Tomac has reached heights in the sport that few riders in history have achieved.

With multiple championships across both disciplines and a record number of wins at prestigious events like the Daytona Supercross, Tomac's legacy as one of the sport's all-time greats is secure. His combination of raw speed, physical conditioning, and mental toughness has made him the benchmark against which all other modern riders are measured.

## Professional Career

Tomac turned professional in 2010 with GEICO Honda in the 250 class. After winning the 2013 AMA 250 Motocross Championship, he moved to the premier 450 class in 2014, where he would gradually establish himself as the dominant force in American motocross racing.

His initial years in the 450 class with GEICO Honda and then Monster Energy Kawasaki saw him develop into a consistent threat, particularly in outdoor motocross, where he won three consecutive Pro Motocross Championships from 2017 to 2019.

While outdoor success came quickly, Supercross championships proved more elusive until 2020, when he captured his first AMA Supercross 450 title. After joining Monster Energy Yamaha Star Racing in 2022, Tomac reached new heights, sweeping both the Supercross and Motocross championships that year and successfully defending his Supercross title in 2023.

His 2023 season was cut short by a devastating Achilles tendon injury, but his comeback in 2024 has added another remarkable chapter to his storied career, including a record-extending seventh win at the prestigious Daytona Supercross.

## Riding Style

Tomac's riding style is characterized by explosive power and an unmatched ability to find speed where others cannot. While many riders excel in certain types of terrain or conditions, Tomac has proven capable of dominating in virtually any environment:

- On rough, high-speed outdoor tracks, his physical conditioning and aggressive approach create separation from competitors
- In technical supercross sections, his precise throttle control and body positioning allow him to execute complex rhythm combinations consistently
- His trademark "beast mode" charges in the second half of races have become legendary, with Tomac often finding another gear when others are fading

What sets Tomac apart is not just his technique but his remarkable ability to push beyond normal physical limits when a race is on the line. This mental fortitude, combined with his natural talent and work ethic, has resulted in some of the most memorable come-from-behind victories in the sport's history.

## The Colorado Factor

Unlike many professional riders who relocate to training facilities in Florida, California, or other motocross hubs, Tomac has maintained his base in Colorado throughout his career. Training at elevation provides natural advantages for cardiovascular development, while the varied terrain of his private training facility allows him to prepare for any conditions he might face during the season.

This connection to his roots reflects Tomac's independent approach to racing. Rather than following the common path, he has forged his own way, developing training methods and preparation techniques specifically tailored to his needs and preferences.

## Legacy and Records

Tomac's statistical achievements place him among the sport's all-time elite:

- His seven wins at the prestigious Daytona Supercross (2016, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023) broke Ricky Carmichael's previous record of five
- With multiple championships in both Supercross and Motocross, he joins an exclusive club of riders who have dominated both disciplines
- His consistent presence at the front of the field for over a decade demonstrates a longevity that few riders achieve

Beyond the numbers, Tomac's impact on the sport includes raising the bar for physical preparation and professional approach. His workmanlike attitude, limited social media presence, and focus on results over personality have established a blueprint for professional success that younger riders now emulate.

## Off the Track

Away from racing, Tomac maintains a relatively private life. Married with a young daughter, he balances family time with the demands of professional racing. His hobbies include mountain biking (following in his father's footsteps), hunting, and maintaining his collection of vintage dirt bikes.

Unlike many modern athletes who cultivate a larger-than-life public persona, Tomac lets his racing do the talking. This approach has earned him tremendous respect within the industry, where he is known for his professionalism, work ethic, and straightforward demeanor.
