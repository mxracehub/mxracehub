# Responsible Gambling

At MXRaceHub, we believe that betting on motocross and supercross races should be an entertaining experience. We are committed to promoting responsible gambling and providing our users with the information and tools they need to maintain control over their betting activities.

## Our Commitment

We are dedicated to:

- Providing a safe and secure betting environment
- Helping users make informed decisions about their gambling
- Offering tools to manage betting activity
- Supporting users who may be experiencing gambling-related problems
- Preventing underage gambling
- Complying with all applicable gambling regulations

## Self-Assessment

Ask yourself these questions to evaluate your gambling habits:

- Do you bet with money needed for essential expenses?
- Do you borrow money to gamble?
- Has gambling negatively affected your relationships?
- Do you gamble to escape problems or relieve negative emotions?
- Have you tried to cut back on gambling without success?
- Do you feel anxious or irritable when not gambling?
- Do you chase losses by betting more?
- Do you lie about your gambling activities?

If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, it may be time to consider using our responsible gambling tools or seeking additional support.
