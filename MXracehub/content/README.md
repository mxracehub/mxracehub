## What Works in This Demo

- Browsing rider profiles

- Exploring teams information
- Navigating track details
- Viewing the format of betting forms

## What Doesn't Work

Since GitHub Pages only hosts static websites without server functionality, the following features are not available:

- User login and registration
- Placing actual bets
- Saving betting forms
- Creating or joining groups
- Payment processing

## Full Version

The full version of MXRaceHub includes all features with complete backend functionality. Contact us to experience the complete platform.
