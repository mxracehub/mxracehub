## How It Works {#how-it-works}

### How do betting groups work?
Betting groups allow you to create private competitions among friends. Group administrators can set custom rules, entry fees, and prize structures. Members place bets on upcoming races and earn points based on the accuracy of their predictions.

### Is betting with real money allowed?
Yes, groups can choose to bet with real money through our secure wallet system. All transactions are processed through our professional payment gateway with bank-grade security.

### How are winners determined?
Winners are determined based on the rules set by each group. Members earn points for correctly predicting race outcomes such as podium finishers, holeshot winners, or fastest qualifiers. Some groups operate on a per-race basis, while others maintain season-long competitions.

### Can I be in multiple betting groups?
Absolutely! You can join as many betting groups as you'd like. This allows you to participate in different types of competitions simultaneously, from casual friendly bets to more serious competitions.

### How do I invite friends to my group?
When you create an invite-only group, you'll receive a unique invite code. Share this code with friends you want to join your group. They can enter the code in the "Join a Group" section to quickly join your betting circle.

### What happens if a race is cancelled?
If a race is cancelled or postponed, all bets for that event are automatically void and any entry fees are returned to participants' wallets. The group administrator will be notified and can reschedule bets for the makeup date.
