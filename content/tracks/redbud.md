## America's Motocross Track

RedBud MX is widely considered the crown jewel of American motocross tracks. Located in the rolling hills of southwestern Michigan, this iconic facility hosts what many consider to be the most patriotic and energetic round of the AMA Pro Motocross Championship. Traditionally held during Independence Day weekend, the RedBud National combines world-class racing with an atmosphere that celebrates both motocross and American pride.

The track's signature red clay soil, enormous jumps, and enthusiastic fans who line the fences screaming "RedBuuuuuuuudddd!" have cemented its reputation as a must-attend event for motocross enthusiasts across the country.

## Track Design and Characteristics

RedBud features one of the longest and most diverse layouts on the Pro Motocross calendar. The track offers a perfect mix of high-speed sections, technical corners, elevation changes, and spectacular jumps. Key features include:

- **LaRocco's Leap**: Named after Mike LaRocco who was the first to clear it during a race, this massive uphill jump stands as one of motocross' most iconic obstacles. Only the most skilled and brave riders attempt it during races.
- **The Skyshot**: A massive uphill double jump that sends riders soaring against the Michigan sky.
- **Bonzai Hill**: A steep downhill section that tests riders' nerve and control.
- **The Sandbox**: A deep sand section that develops challenging lines throughout the day.

The soil at RedBud is a particular highlightâ€”a loamy clay that holds moisture well and creates optimal traction. Track owner Tim Ritchie and his crew are known for their meticulous track preparation, creating a racing surface that allows for multiple lines and passing opportunities.

## The RedBud Experience

What truly sets RedBud apart from other motocross venues is the fan experience. The July 4th weekend event has become a tradition for thousands of motocross enthusiasts who camp on-site, creating a festival atmosphere that extends well beyond the racing.

The facility offers excellent spectator viewing from multiple elevated vantage points, allowing fans to see most of the track from several locations. The passionate crowd, many adorned in red, white, and blue attire, creates an electric atmosphere unlike any other stop on the circuit.

The track has hosted not only the annual Pro Motocross National but also the prestigious Motocross of Nations in 2018, which brought teams from countries around the world to compete in what's often called the "Olympics of Motocross."

## Broadcasting and Media Coverage

As one of the premier events on the Pro Motocross calendar, the RedBud National receives comprehensive broadcast coverage. The event is typically broadcast live on NBC and the MAVTV Motorsports Network, with additional streaming options available through the NBC Sports app.

The iconic nature of the track, combined with the enthusiastic crowd and typically high-quality racing, makes RedBud a centerpiece of the motocross season's media coverage.

## Amateur Racing

Beyond the professional event, RedBud hosts numerous amateur racing events throughout the season, providing opportunities for riders of all skill levels to experience this world-class facility. The track is known for maintaining consistent quality for both professional and amateur events, making it a favorite destination for racers at all levels.
