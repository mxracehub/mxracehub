## Stadium Overview

Raymond James Stadium, affectionately known as "Ray Jay" by locals, serves as one of the premier venues on the Monster Energy AMA Supercross circuit. Home to the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, this impressive facility transforms into a world-class Supercross battleground each season, challenging riders with its unique Florida conditions and typically technical track designs.

The stadium's open-air design allows for expansive track layouts while its location in Tampa provides riders and fans with the warm Florida weather that stands in stark contrast to many of the colder rounds on the early Supercross calendar. With excellent sightlines throughout the venue and the stadium's signature 103-foot steel pirate ship creating a distinctive backdrop, Raymond James Stadium delivers one of the most distinctive Supercross experiences of the season.

## Track Characteristics

Tampa Supercross tracks are known for several distinctive characteristics that set them apart from other rounds:

### Florida Soil
Unlike the harder-packed dirt used at many Supercross venues, the Tampa soil typically contains more sand content, creating unique traction conditions that can change dramatically throughout the event. This sandier composition tends to:
- Break down more quickly, forming deeper ruts in corners and landings
- Create a more technical racing surface as the night progresses
- Reward riders with excellent technique and adaptability

### Technical Layout
Track designs at Raymond James Stadium frequently feature:
- Complex rhythm sections requiring precise timing and commitment
- Multiple line options that reward creative riders
- Challenging whoops sections that often become decisive factors in race outcomes
- A mix of tighter corners and faster sections that test riders' versatility

### Weather Influence
The open-air design means that:
- Afternoon Florida sun can dry the track significantly before the night program
- Evening humidity can change traction conditions as the main events approach
- Occasional rain threats add an element of unpredictability

## Notable Moments in Tampa Supercross History

Raymond James Stadium has hosted several memorable Supercross moments throughout its history:
